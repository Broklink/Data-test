# Oh, hey...

So you clicked on this README, huh?  
Well… bad news: there’s actually nothing useful here.  
No deep documentation, no setup instructions, no cool hidden features.

Still reading? Wow, you're committed. I respect that.  
But seriously — if you're looking for something insightful or technical, this ain't it.

I mean, sure, you can scroll down more, but it’s just going to be more of this nonsense.  
If you're expecting a plot twist or a hidden flag, sorry to disappoint.  
There is no spoon. There is no README. There is only... regret.

You can hit the back button now. Or alt+F4. Or just reflect on your life choices.  
Either way, this README is officially over. Go outside. Touch grass. Live a little.

Thanks for stopping by, I guess.
